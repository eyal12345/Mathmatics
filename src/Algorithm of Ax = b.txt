system linear equations: algorithm for solution system Ax = b
* A -> matrix of coefficients
* b -> vector of coefficients
* n -> vector space
* x -> solution of system

number of possible vectors for solution system linear equations:
* zero -> not exist solutions for system Ax = b
* one -> exist single solution for system Ax = b vector space R(n)
* infinite under vector space R(n) -> the system linear equations is homogeneus

given system linear equations Ax = b so (let us define for cases that n = 0 or n = 1: A[0][0] = a ,b[0] = b as scalars):
* if n = 0 then:
	* if a = 0 and b = 0 then exists infinite solutions for equation
	  (specific case for homogeneus equations: solution is x = k*{1} for any k is real).
	* if a = 0 and b != 0 then does not exist at all solution for equation.
* if n = 1 and a != 0 then exist single solution for equation ax = b in vector space R1 (solution is x = {b/a}).
* if n > 1 then:
	* if det(A) = 0 then:
		* if b = 0 (zero vector) then system equations is homogeneus so that kx is solution for any k is real
		  and x that found in X (X is vector's collection that linear dependent in x).
		* if b != 0 then does not exist at all x that belongs to X for system equations Ax = b.
	* if det(A) != 0 then exist single vector x for vector space R(n) so that equality Ax = b exists.

algorithm pattern for solution system linear equations:
input:
* A -> matrix of coefficients
* b -> vector of coefficients
output:
* x -> solution of system

algorithm solve system is:
v -> length of A
initialize vector x
if n is bigger than 1 then:
	if determine of A is 0 then:
		if b is zero vector then:
			A' its ranking of A matrix
			suppose that xn = 1
			for each i from 1 to n - 1 do:
				move coefficients of xn in A' to right side
			cutting from A' row n and column n
			b' its n - 1 first values from b
			x' its solving of sub-system A'x' = b' in vector space R(n - 1)
			x its adding of xn to x'
			the solution is homogenues for any x that found in X
		else:
			does not exists solutions for this system
	else:
		x its solving of system Ax = b
		exist single solution for this system in vector space R(n)
else:
	if n is exactly 1 and a is not 0 then:
		exist single solution for this equation in vector space R1: x -> {b/a}
	else:
		if a and b they exactly 0 then:
			the solution is homogenues for any k real so that x = k*{1}
		if a is exactly 0 and b is not 0:
			does not exists solutions for this equation

conditions for algorithm:
* A is square matrix and its length equal to length of vector b
